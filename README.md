 ## General:
 ## 0.Git Basics

Before listening first and second weeks of curse [Introduction to Git and GitHub](https://www.coursera.org/learn/introduction-git-github) I listened another [course](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=O00FTZDxD0o) from Bogdan Stashchuk . It is makes all easier. Also I used some GIT commands earlier in VS Code.

Actually earlier I used few of Linux commands, but [Linux Survival](https://linuxsurvival.com/linux-tutorial-introduction/) showed many useful commands in practice . I liked this tutorial.
What about HTTP it was hard for me to understanding all theory about working HTTP. But earlier I learned some theory and apply in practice some methods like GET, POST, PUSH, DELETE.
