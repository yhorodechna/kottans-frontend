 ## General:
 ## 0.Git Basics

Before listening first and second weeks of curse [Introduction to Git and GitHub](https://www.coursera.org/learn/introduction-git-github) I listened another [course](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=O00FTZDxD0o) from Bogdan Stashchuk . It is makes all easier. Also I used some GIT commands earlier in VS Code.

<details>
<summary>Task Linux CLI</summary>

Actually earlier I used few of Linux commands, but [Linux Survival](https://linuxsurvival.com/linux-tutorial-introduction/) showed many useful commands in practice . I liked this tutorial.
What about HTTP it was hard for me to understanding all theory about working HTTP. But earlier I learned some theory and apply in practice some methods like GET, POST, PUSH, DELETE.

## 2.Git Collaboration

After listening third and fourth weeks of course [Introduction to Git and GitHub](https://www.coursera.org/learn/introduction-git-github) I write down some useful commands witch I will use in the feature. But I have to notice that this time it wos difficult to pass all levels in the game [Learn Git Branching](https://learngitbranching.js.org/?locale=en_US). So I will come back to it.


## Front-End Basics

## 3.Intro to HTML and CSS

I really liked course of HTML and CSS from [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn). It is easy for beginners to understand how work HTML and CSS on practice.
Actually some years ego I have a lot of practice with used HTML and CSS, for example I learned HTML code used design layout in this online [course](https://m.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLM6XATa8CAG4uCli-pMvuvwj46UaQoqIc).
