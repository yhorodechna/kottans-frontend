 ## 0.Git Basics

Before listening first and second weeks of curse [Introduction to Git and GitHub](https://www.coursera.org/learn/introduction-git-github) I listened another [course](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=O00FTZDxD0o) from Bogdan Stashchuk . It is makes all easier. Also I used some GIT commands earlier in VS Code.

<details>
<summary>Task Linux CLI</summary>

</details>

Actually earlier I used few of Linux commands, but [Linux Survival](https://linuxsurvival.com/linux-tutorial-introduction/) showed many useful commands in practice . I liked this tutorial.
What about HTTP it was hard for me to understanding all theory about working HTTP. But earlier I learned some theory and apply in practice some methods like GET, POST, PUSH, DELETE.

## 2.Git Collaboration

</details>

After listening third and fourth weeks of course [Introduction to Git and GitHub](https://www.coursera.org/learn/introduction-git-github) I write down some useful commands witch I will use in the feature. But I have to notice that this time it wos difficult to pass all levels in the game [Learn Git Branching](https://learngitbranching.js.org/?locale=en_US). So I will come back to it.

<summary>Task HTML and CSS intro</summary>

</details>

I really liked course of HTML and CSS from [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn). It is easy for beginners to understand how work HTML and CSS on practice.
Actually some years ego I have a lot of practice with used HTML and CSS, for example I learned HTML code used design layout in this online [course](https://m.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLM6XATa8CAG4uCli-pMvuvwj46UaQoqIc).

## 4.Responsive Web Design

<details>
<summary>Task Responsive Web Design</summary> 

![screen-01](img/task_responsive_web_design/flexbox_froggy.png)

</details>

Corses of [Flexbox](https://m.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLM6XATa8CAG5mPV60dMmjMRrHVW4LmV2x) and [Grid](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=GV92IdMGFfA&list=PLM6XATa8CAG5pXQrW_kDaeZb_uIAMNZIm) I passed two years ago. But it was useful for me to recall the various nuances. And the most useful it is [short description](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=GV92IdMGFfA&list=PLM6XATa8CAG5pXQrW_kDaeZb_uIAMNZIm) from "Фрілансер по життю" about different topics, includes Flexbox and Grid. Also two years ago I passed games [Flexbox froggy](http://flexboxfroggy.com/) and [Grid garden](http://cssgridgarden.com/).

## 5.HTML & CSS Practice

[Demo](https://yhorodechna.github.io/html-css-popup/)

It was an interesting experience with using tag input for popup. Also I saw my mistakes and understand how to correct them.

## 6.JS Basics

<details>
<summary>Task JS Basics</summary>

![screen-06](img/task__js__basics/intermediate_algorithm_scripting.png)

</details>

I used JS earlier. It was useful to to recall some methods of arrays and other topics. Also I write down some unknown to me thinks. I must note that it was very hard for me to dy all tasks from Intermediate Algorithm Scripting... Only at the time of this writing, I read that it was necessary to do only the first eleven tasks. So, it was hard but useful for me.
